# About the Project:

1. Multi-Tier Web Application Project.
    
2. Setup on Laptop/Desktop.
    
3. Baseline for the upcoming project.
    
4. It will help any project setup locally.
    

# Tools:

1. Hypervisor - Oracle VM VirtualBox
    
2. Automation - Vagrant
    
3. Command Line Interface (CLI)
    
4. IDE
    

# Architecture Design of Project Services:

1. Nginx
    
2. Tomcat
    
3. RabbitMQ
    
4. Memcached
    
5. MySql
    
6. Vagrant
    
7. VirtualBox
    
8. Git Bash

* **User Input**: The user begins by entering the IP address, which corresponds to the load balancer. Nginx is used for efficient load balancing.
    
* **Load Balancing**: The load balancer, powered by Nginx, intelligently routes incoming requests to the Apache Tomcat server. This server hosts a Java-based web application.
    
* **Storage**: NFS (Network File System) is employed for storage purposes, ensuring data availability and reliability.
    
* **Messaging Queue**: Apache Tomcat is connected to RabbitMQ, a robust message broker (also known as a queueing agent), to facilitate seamless communication between components.
    
* **User Interaction**: At the Apache Tomcat server, the user provides login details through a user interface.
    
* **Data Retrieval**: The application processes the user's request by executing SQL queries to access information stored in a MySQL database.
    
* **Caching**: Before reaching the MySQL database, the data retrieval process passes through a Memcached server. Memcached is utilized for caching login details, improving query response times and system performance.
    

# Design for Automation Stack:

Vagrant + Oracle VM Box + Bash Scripts = To set up the above services

* **Vagrant for Automated VM Setup**: We harness the power of Vagrant to automate the configuration of our virtual machines. Vagrant acts as an intermediary, communicating with the Oracle VM VirtualBox, our chosen hypervisor, to create and manage virtual machines seamlessly.
    
* **Oracle VM VirtualBox**: This serves as our hypervisor, enabling us to create, configure, and control virtual machines, ensuring a robust and efficient virtualization environment.
    
* **Bash Commands for Service Setup**: We employ the versatility of Bash commands to set up and configure the various services on our virtual machines. Bash scripting provides the flexibility and control necessary to fine-tune our system to meet our specific requirements.
