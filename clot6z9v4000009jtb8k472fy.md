# How to declare ?

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699615704830/27c6dbb6-dbd4-4a41-bfce-1e374bcdb675.png align="center")

"$" it used to access the package

# Example of Command line Arguments:

```bash
#! /bin/bash

# Check if the required number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <web_template_url>"
    exit 1
fi

web_template_url="$1"

######## Install required packages ########
sudo yum install wget unzip httpd -y

######## Start and enable Apache HTTP server ########
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

######## Create a temporary directory for web files ########
mkdir -p /tmp/webfiles
cd /tmp/webfiles

######## Download and extract a web template ########
wget "$web_template_url"
template_filename=$(basename "$web_template_url")
unzip "$template_filename"

######## Copy the extracted files to the web server's directory ########
sudo cp -r "$template_filename"/* /var/www/html/

######## Restart the Apache HTTP server to apply changes ########
sudo systemctl restart httpd

######## Clean up: Remove the temporary directory ########
rm -rf /tmp/webfiles
```

To run we use `./your_script.sh` [`https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2136_kool_form_pack.zip`](https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2136_kool_form_pack.zip)

In the modified script, command line arguments are utilized to make the script more flexible and configurable. Let's break down the relevant parts related to command line arguments:

```bash
# Check if the required number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <web_template_url>"
    exit 1
fi

web_template_url="$1"
```

1. `$#` represents the number of command line arguments provided to the script.
    
2. The `if` statement checks whether the number of arguments is not equal to 1. If it's not, the script displays a usage message and exits.
    
3. `$0` is a special variable representing the script's name itself, used in the usage message to indicate how to correctly use the script.
    
4. `"$1"` is the first command line argument provided to the script, which is expected to be the URL of the web template.
    
5. The provided URL is assigned to the variable `web_template_url`.
    

So, when you run the script, you should provide the web template URL as a command line argument. For example:

```bash
./your_script.sh https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2136_kool_form_pack.zip
```

This allows you to reuse the same script with different web template URLs without modifying the script itself. It adds flexibility and makes the script more versatile for different use cases.

# System Varibles:

In Bash scripting, system variables (also known as environment variables) are special variables that hold information about the environment in which the shell is running. These variables are set by the system and can be accessed by scripts to obtain information or modify behavior. Here are some commonly used system variables in Bash:

1. `$HOME`: Represents the home directory of the user.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Home directory: $HOME"
    ```
    
2. `$USER` and `$LOGNAME`: Contain the username of the current user.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Username: $USER"
    ```
    
3. `$PATH`: Contains a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for executable files.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Path: $PATH"
    ```
    
4. `$PWD`: Represents the current working directory.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Current working directory: $PWD"
    ```
    
5. `$SHELL`: Indicates the path to the shell.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Shell path: $SHELL"
    ```
    
6. `$TERM`: Specifies the terminal type.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Terminal type: $TERM"
    ```
    
7. `$UID` and `$EUID`: Contain the user ID and effective user ID, respectively.
    
    ```bash
    echo "User ID: $UID"
    ```
    
8. `$HOSTNAME`: Represents the hostname of the machine.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
    ```
    
9. `$RANDOM`: Generates a random integer between 0 and 32767.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Random number: $RANDOM"
    ```
    
10. `$BASH_VERSION`: Displays the version of Bash.
    
    ```bash
    echo "Bash version: $BASH_VERSION"
    ```
    

These are just a few examples of system variables available in Bash. You can use the `env` command to see a list of all environment variables in your current shell session. For example:

```bash
env
```

This will display a list of all environment variables along with their values.

# Quotes in Bash Scripting:

In Bash scripting, quotes are used to define the boundaries of a string. There are three types of quotes in Bash: single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), and backticks (\`\`).

1. **Single Quotes (**`'`):
    
    * Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. No variable substitution or command substitution occurs within single quotes.
        
    
    ```bash
    echo 'This is a single-quoted string'
    ```
    
    The output will be: `This is a single-quoted string`
    
2. **Double Quotes (**`"`):
    
    * Double quotes allow for variable substitution and command substitution. They also preserve the literal value of most characters within the quotes.
        
    
    ```bash
    name="John"
    echo "Hello, $name!"
    ```
    
    The output will be: `Hello, John!`
    
    Double quotes also allow for escaping certain characters to include them literally:
    
    ```bash
    echo "This is a double-quoted string with a \"quote\" inside."
    ```
    
    The output will be: `This is a double-quoted string with a "quote" inside.`
    
3. **Backticks (\`\`): (Command Subsitution)**
    
    * Backticks (grave accents) are used for command substitution. The command within backticks is executed, and its output is substituted in place.
        
    
    ```bash
    current_date=`date`
    echo "Current date is: $current_date"
    ```
    
    The output will be something like: `Current date is: Tue Nov 9 12:34:56 UTC 2023`
    
    Note: The use of backticks for command substitution is deprecated in favor of `$()` syntax.
    
    ```bash
    current_date=$(date)
    echo "Current date is: $current_date"
    ```
    
    This accomplishes the same result as the previous example.
    

In summary, quotes in Bash serve different purposes:

* Single quotes (`'`) preserve the literal value of each character.
    
* Double quotes (`"`) allow variable and command substitution, but still preserve the literal value of most characters.
    
* Backticks (\`\`) are used for command substitution, but `$()` is preferred for clarity and readability in modern Bash scripting.

# Exporting Variables:

In Bash scripting, you can use the `export` command to make a variable available to child processes, effectively turning it into an environment variable. Here are examples of exporting variables:

### Example 1: Exporting a Variable

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a variable
my_var="Hello, World!"

# Export the variable
export my_var

# Run a script that uses the exported variable
./another_script.sh
```

In this example, `my_var` is defined and then exported. The variable will be accessible in `another_script.sh` as an environment variable.

### Example 2: Using Exported Variables in Another Script

Let's assume `another_script.sh` looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Access the exported variable
echo "In another script: $my_var"
```

When you run the main script, it sets and exports `my_var`, and then it executes `another_script.sh`. The output of `another_script.sh` will be:

```bash
In another script: Hello, World!
```

### Example 3: Exporting Variables Directly

You can also export a variable in a single line without first defining it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Export a variable directly
export another_var="This is another variable"

# Run a script that uses the exported variable
./yet_another_script.sh
```

In this case, `another_var` is defined and exported in one step.

### Example 4: Viewing Exported Variables

To see a list of all currently exported variables, you can use the `export` command without any arguments:

```bash
export
```

This will display a list of all exported variables and their values.

### Example 5: Exporting Variables for Subsequent Commands

Variables can be exported just for the duration of a single command using the `VAR=value command` syntax:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Export variable for a single command
my_temp_var="Temporary value" another_var="Another temporary value" ./some_command.sh
```

In this case, `some_command.sh` will have access to `my_temp_var` and `another_var` for the duration of its execution.

Remember that exported variables are inherited by child processes but not by parent processes. Any changes made in a child process will not affect the parent process.

These examples illustrate how to use the `export` command to make variables available as environment variables for child processes.

**Also if you want to make a variable permanent** across sessions and for all scripts, you can add the export statement to your shell configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc` for Bash. Here's an example:

1. Open or create your `~/.bashrc` file using a text editor.
    
    ```bash
    vim ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
2. Add the following line to export a variable:
    
    ```bash
    export my_permanent_var="This variable is permanent!"
    ```
    
    You can replace "This variable is permanent!" with the actual value you want to assign.
    
3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
    
4. To apply the changes, either restart your terminal or run:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    

Now, the variable `my_permanent_var` will be available in all new terminal sessions.

Here's an example script (`use_permanent_var.sh`) that uses the exported variable:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Using the permanent variable: $my_permanent_var"
```

When you run this script, it will access the `my_permanent_var` variable set in your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
./use_permanent_var.sh
```

The export in `~/.bashrc` ensures that `my_permanent_var` is available in every new Bash session. This makes the variable persistent across sessions and scripts, making it essentially "permanent" as long as you're using the same user account on the system.  
  
**For globally use the** `/etc/profile` **it will ensure changes across users.**

# User Input in Scripts:

In Bash scripting, you can use the `read` command to take user input. The `read` command reads a line of text from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and assigns it to a variable. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for input
echo "Please enter your name:"
read user_name

# Display a greeting using the input
echo "Hello, $user_name! Welcome to the script."
```

Explanation:

1. `echo "Please enter your name:"`: Displays a prompt asking the user to enter their name.
    
2. `read user_name`: Reads the user's input and assigns it to the variable `user_name`.
    
3. `echo "Hello, $user_name! Welcome to the script."`: Displays a greeting using the input provided by the user.
    

When you run this script, it will wait for you to enter your name, and then it will display a personalized greeting.

You can also use the `-p` option with `read` to combine the prompt and input statement and you can use `-s` to suppress the password:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read user input with a prompt
read -p "Please enter your name: " user_name
read -sp "please enter password: " password

# Display a greeting using the input
echo "Hello, $user_name! Welcome to the script."
```

# Decision Making (if-else):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user to enter a number
read -p "Enter a number: " NUM
echo

# Check if the entered number is greater than 100
if [ "$NUM" -gt 100 ]; then
    # If the condition is true, execute the following commands
    echo "We have entered the IF block."
    sleep 3
    echo "Your number is greater than 100."
    echo
    date
else 
    echo "Number is less than 100"
fi
# to mark the end of if and else block

# Regardless of the condition, this line will be executed
echo "Script execution"
```

### elif:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Execute the command and store the result in the 'value' variable
value=$(ip addr show | grep -v LOOPBACK | grep -ic mtu)

# Check the value of 'value' variable using if-elif-else statements
if [ $value -eq 1 ]; then
    # If there is exactly 1 active network interface, print the following message
    echo "1 Active network interface found"
elif [ $value -gt 1 ]; then
    # If there are more than 1 active network interfaces, print the following message
    echo "Found multiple active interfaces."
else
    # If there are no active network interfaces, print the following message
    echo "No active interfaces found"
fi
```

# Monitoring Script:

Let's right a script if a process is running if not we will start the process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

date
ls /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid &> /dev/null

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
   echo "Httpd process is running."
else
   echo "Httpd process is not running"
   echo "Starting the process"
  sudo systemctl start httpd
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]
   then
      echo "Process started successfully"
   else
      echo "Process Starting Failed, contact the admin"
   fi      
fi
```

**Now, lets schedule this script to run automatically:**

For that we will use `crontab` :

Type `crontab -e` :

```bash
# MM HH DOM mm DOW COMMAND
30 20 * * 1-5 COMMAND
* * * * *  /opt/scripts/11_monit.sh &>> /var/log/monit_httpd.log
```

# Loops:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example 1: Loop through a range of numbers
echo "Example 1: Loop through a range of numbers"
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done

# Example 2: Loop through an array of values
echo -e "\nExample 2: Loop through an array of values"
fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Orange" "Grapes")
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"
do
    echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize a counter
counter=1

# Example 1: Simple while loop
echo "Example 1: Simple while loop"
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Iteration $counter"
    ((counter++))  # Increment the counter
done

# Example 2: While loop with user input
echo -e "\nExample 2: While loop with user input"
echo "Enter a number (enter 0 to exit):"
read user_input

while [ $user_input -ne 0 ]
do
    echo "You entered: $user_input"
    echo "Enter another number (enter 0 to exit):"
    read user_input
done

echo "End of the script"
```

# Remote Command Execution:

Do `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh scriptbox and do sudo -i` for the below file:

```bash
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.define "scriptbox" do |scriptbox|    
    scriptbox.vm.box = "jacobw/fedora35-arm64"
    scriptbox.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.26"
    scriptbox.vm.hostname = "scriptbox"
    scriptbox.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |v|
      v.allowlist_verified = true
      v.ssh_info_public = true
        v.gui = true
    end
    scriptbox.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
     mv /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo /tmp/
     mv /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates-modular.repo /tmp/
     yum clean all
     yum update
     systemctl stop firewalld
    SHELL
  end
    config.vm.define "web01" do |web01|    
    web01.vm.box = "jacobw/fedora35-arm64"
    web01.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.27"
    web01.vm.hostname = "web01"
    web01.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |v|
      v.allowlist_verified = true
      v.ssh_info_public = true
        v.gui = true
    end
    web01.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
     mv /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo /tmp/
     mv /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates-modular.repo /tmp/
     yum clean all
     yum update
     systemctl stop firewalld
    SHELL
  end
    config.vm.define "web02" do |web02|    
    web02.vm.box = "jacobw/fedora35-arm64"
    web02.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.28"
    web02.vm.hostname = "web02"
    web02.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |v|
      v.allowlist_verified = true
      v.ssh_info_public = true
        v.gui = true
    end
    web02.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
     mv /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo /tmp/
     mv /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates-modular.repo /tmp/
     yum clean all
     yum update
     systemctl stop firewalld
    SHELL
  end
    config.vm.define "web03" do |web03|    
    web03.vm.box = "spox/ubuntu-arm" 
    web03.vm.box_version = "1.0.0"
    web03.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.29"
    web03.vm.hostname = "web03"
    web03.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |v|
      v.allowlist_verified = true
      v.ssh_info_public = true
        v.gui = true
    end
  end
end
```

Add the IP address of web01, web02, and web03 to `/etc/hosts` file in scriptbox.

ping the VMS from scriptbox to check.

Do `ssh vagrant@web01` .

Then create a user using `useradd devops` and give a password using `passed devops`.

Add the devops to the sudoers file to give administrative access.  
DO the same for web02 and web03 as well

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699654444206/fefd411c-8569-4190-997e-627c5c7b22e4.png align="center")

So, above you can see how I executed a command on web01 by being scriptbox VM.

# SSH Key Exchange:

In the above, it is always asking us for a password. So now we will do key based login which is a safer login.

So do ssh-keygen - The `ssh-keygen` command is used to generate SSH key pairs. SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys that can be used to securely authenticate and communicate between two parties over an insecure network.

Then press enter for the following.

Then do `ssh-copy-id devops@web01` - The `ssh-copy-id` command is used to install your public key on a remote server, allowing you to log in without the need for a password.

Do the same for web02 and web03.

Now, you run commands without typing the password.
